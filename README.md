# SCP-XXXX - A terminal interface to the SCP database

**Work in progress**

-----

**SCP-XXXX**

**Object Class**: Safe

**Containment**:

SCP-XXXX is used as the primary interface to SCP's primary database, obviating the need for
SCP itself to develop a system of its own.

**Description**:

SCP-XXXX is a computer program developed and released for a computer built within
the 1980s. It presents a textual interface that allows the user to authenticate themselves
and then browse permissible records within the SCP database.

Discovered in ██████████████, SCP agents noted that SCP-XXXX was aware of the description and
classification of anomalous objects not-yet categorised. Researcher ██████ noted that the
information was not always correct, but somehow adapted itself over time to become more
correct, although not completely.

Several researchers have attempted to disassemble the code and reverse-engineer SCP-XXXX.
Replicating the interface and user experience is successful, but the anomalous property
of describing new SCPs was not reproduced.

The decision was made to use SCP-XXXX in place of a bespoke cataloguing system and early-warning system, 
resulting in a net ████ reduction in operational costs and a net reduction in the time between
SCP manifestation and discovery.
